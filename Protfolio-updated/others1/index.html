      <p>
      My first impression of reduce was as name implies that it will implement some function on an array and the final output will be reduced to a single value. But later I
      discovered that It can do more than that. The skeleton of the reduce function can be defined as it has one variable(accumulator) and a function in which it will iterate to
      each element of the array starting from the first and updating the accumulator value before moving to every next element in an array. The interesting thing comes into play
      when the inner function is executed and updating the accumulator as it will determine the kind of output that this reduce function will produce and thatâ€™s where it is very
      useful.</p>
